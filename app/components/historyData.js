    p1: "The Pre-Maya Era marks the early development of Maya society, transitioning from nomadic hunter-gatherer groups to settled agricultural communities. The domestication of key crops like maize, beans, and squash enabled stable food production, allowing villages to form in the lowlands and highlands of Mesoamerica. This transformation was crucial for the emergence of more complex societal structures, as it provided the foundation for the Maya civilization's future growth and urbanization.",
    p2: 'During this period, early Maya communities began to develop their unique cultural identity, influenced by neighboring groups such as the Olmec. These interactions sparked the growth of ceremonial practices and the creation of essential tools like pottery and stone implements. The foundations for later Maya achievements in architecture, art, and social organization were laid, setting the stage for the more advanced developments seen in the following centuries.',
